# StockFlow-Alpha
Inventory Management for Micro Home-Based Businesses (HBB)

## Project Overview
StockFlow is a one-week Proof-of-Concept project that aims to simplify inventory management and streamline the point of sale (POS) process for micro home-based businesses (HBBs). This system is designed to help HBB owners efficiently control their inventory and manage sales operations. In this initial phase of development, our primary focus will be on creating the Inventory Module and POS Module.
